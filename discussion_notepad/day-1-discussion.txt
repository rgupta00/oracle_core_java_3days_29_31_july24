some mcq:
-----------

Q. what is the op?

long a=9958543978;
System.out.println(a);


Q. what is the op?
char i=97; //storing int into char
System.out.println(i);
	

Q. What is the op?
	int i=028;
	System.out.println(i);


Note: No starting from 0 are octal, 0-7 
      how to convert octal to int
	
	0 2 6 
	  2*8 power 1 +  6*8 power 0
	  2*8+6=22


Q. What is the op?

 upcasting vs downcasting
 
	byte i=33;
	byte j=22;
	byte k=i+j;
	System.out.println(k);
	    

Note : range of byte (8 bits): -178 0 to +128


Q. what is the op?

	  int $=44;
	  System.out.println($);



Q. How to write a program to call main twice? Think?


Q. how to execute comments?
// \u000d System.out.println("i love java");


Q. What is the op?
		int String =33;
		System.out.println(String);
